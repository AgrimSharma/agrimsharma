                    <p>List is one of the simplest and most important data structures in Python.
                    Lists are enclosed in square brackets [ ] and each item is separated by a comma.
                    Lists are collections of items where each item in the list has an assigned index value.
                    A list is mutable, meaning you can change its contents.

            <ul>
                <li><b>Creation</b>
                    <p>In Python creation of a list is very simple
                    </p><img src="{% static 'images/list.jpeg.html"/></li></br>
                <li><b>Slicing</b>
                    <p>The general method format is: slice(start, stop, increment) , and it is analogous to start:stop:increment when applied to a list or tuple. If you want to know how to slice strings, that's covered in another article titled
                        How to Get a Sub-string From a String in Python â€“ Slicing Strings.<br>
                        <img src="{% static 'images/items.jpeg.html"/>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Length of List</b>
                    <p>So you learnt: to get the size or length of a list or tuple in Python (you probably didn't mean Python array ), you just call the len() function on the object. If you came from PHP / JavaScript, by array , probably you mean list in Python. You can make your custom objects return values to the len() function.
                    <img src="{% static 'images/length.jpg.html"/>
                    </p></li>
                <li><b>Sorting</b>
                    <p>When you write programs in Python, you never need to bother about low-level details such as managing the memory used by your program.
                        <img src="{% static 'images/sort.jpg.html"/>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Append</b>
                    <p>Due to its open-source nature, Python has been ported (i.e. changed to make it work on) to many many platforms. All your Python programs will work on any of these platforms without requiring any changes at all. However, you must be careful enough to avoid any system-dependent features.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can use Python on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, BeOS, OS/390, z/OS, Palm OS, QNX, VMS, Psion, Acorn RISC OS, VxWorks, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE and PocketPC !
                        <img src="{% static 'images/sort.jpg.html"/>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Extend</b>
                    <p>This requires a little explanation.</p>
                    <p>A program written in a compiled language like C or C++ is translated from the source language i.e. C/C++ into a language spoken by your computer (binary code i.e. 0s and 1s) using a compiler with various flags and options. When you run the program, the linker/loader software just stores the binary code in the computer's memory and starts executing from the first instruction in the program.</p>
                    <p>When you use an interpreted language like Python, there is no separate compilation and execution steps. You just run the program from the source code. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes and then translates this into the native language of your specific computer and then runs it. All this makes using Python so much easier. You just run your programs - you never have to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc. They are also more portable this way because you can just copy your Python program into another system of any kind and it just works!

                </li>
                <br/>
                <li><b>Remove and Pop</b>
                   <p>Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming. In procedure-oriented languages, the program is built around procedures or functions which are nothing but reusable pieces of programs. In object-oriented languages, the program is built around objects which combine data and functionality. Python has a very powerful but simple way of doing object-oriented programming, especially, when compared to languages like C++ or Java.

                </li><br/>
                <li><b>Reverse</b>
                   <p>If you need a critical piece of code to run very fast, you can achieve this by writing that piece of code in C, and then combine that with your Python program.
                   </p><img src="{% static 'images/reverse_list.jpg.html"/>
                <li><b>Count</b>
                </li><br/>
                   <p>You can embed Python within your C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for your program's users.<p>

                </li><br/>
                <li><b>Comprehension</b>
                   <p>The Python Standard Library is huge indeed. It can help you do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, ftp, email, XML, XML-RPC, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI(graphical user interfaces) using Tk, and also other system-dependent stuff. Remember, all this is always available wherever Python is installed. This is called the "batteries included" philosophy of Python.

<p>Python has a great built-in list type named "list". List literals are written within square brackets [ ]. Lists work similarly to strings -- use the len() function and square brackets [ ] to access data, with the first element at index 0.  (See the official <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html">python.org list docs</a>.)</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
  colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
  print colors[0]    ## red
  print colors[2]    ## green
  print len(colors)  ## 3
</pre>

<p>
<img src="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/images/list1.png"
 style='display:block; margin:0 auto'
 width=500
 alt="list of strings 'red' 'blue 'green'" /></p>

<p>Assignment with an = on lists does not make a copy. Instead, assignment makes the two variables point to the one list in memory. </p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
  b = colors   ## Does not copy the list
</pre>

<p>
<img src="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/images/list2.png"
 style='display:block; margin:0 auto'
 width=500
alt="both colors and b point to the one list"  /></p>

<p>The "empty list" is just an empty pair of brackets [ ]. The '+' works to append two lists, so [1, 2] + [3, 4] yields [1, 2, 3, 4] (this is just like + with strings).</p>

<h2>FOR and IN</h2>

<p>Python's *for* and *in* constructs are extremely useful, and the first use of them we'll see is with lists. The *for* construct -- <code>for <strong>var</strong> in <strong>list</strong></code> -- is an easy way to look at each element in a list (or other collection). Do not add or remove from the list during iteration.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
  squares = [1, 4, 9, 16]
  sum = 0
  for num in squares:
    sum += num
  print sum  ## 30
</pre>

<p>If you know what sort of thing is in the list, use a variable name in the loop that captures that information such as "num", or "name", or "url". Since python code does not have other syntax to remind you of types, your variable names are a key way for you to keep straight what is going on.</p>

<p>The *in* construct on its own is an easy way to test if an element appears in a list (or other collection) -- <code><strong>value</strong> in <strong>collection</strong></code> -- tests if the value is in the collection, returning True/False.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
  list = ['larry', 'curly', 'moe']
  if 'curly' in list:
    print 'yay'
</pre>

<p>The for/in constructs are very commonly used in Python code and work on data types other than list, so you should just memorize their syntax. You may have habits from other languages where you start manually iterating over a collection, where in Python you should just use for/in.</p>

<p>You can also use for/in to work on a string. The string acts like a list of its chars, so <code>for ch in s: print ch</code> prints all the chars in a string.</p>

<h2>Range </h2>

<p>The range(n) function yields the numbers 0, 1, ... n-1, and range(a, b) returns a, a+1, ... b-1 -- up to but not including the last number. The combination of the for-loop and the range() function allow you to build a traditional numeric for loop:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ## print the numbers from 0 through 99
  for i in range(100):
    print i
</pre>

<p>There is a variant xrange() which avoids the cost of building the whole list for performance sensitive cases (in Python 3000, range() will have the good performance behavior and you can forget about xrange()).</p>

<h2>While Loop</h2>

<p>Python also has the standard while-loop, and the *break* and *continue* statements work as in C++ and Java, altering the course of the innermost loop. The above for/in loops solves the common case of iterating over every element in a list, but the while loop gives you total control over the index numbers. Here's a while loop which accesses every 3rd element in a list:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ## Access every 3rd element in a list
  i = 0
  while i < len(a):
    print a[i]
    i = i + 3
</pre>

<h2>List Methods</h2>

<p>Here are some other common list methods.</p>

<ul>
   <li> list.append(elem) -- adds a single element to the end of the list. Common error: does not return the new list, just modifies the original.</li>

   <li> list.insert(index, elem) -- inserts the element at the given index, shifting elements to the right.</li>

   <li> list.extend(list2) adds the elements in list2 to the end of the list. Using + or += on a list is similar to using extend().</li>

   <li> list.index(elem) -- searches for the given element from the start of the list and returns its index. Throws a ValueError if the element does not appear (use "in" to check without a ValueError).</li>

   <li> list.remove(elem) -- searches for the first instance of the given element and removes it (throws ValueError if not present)</li>

   <li> list.sort() -- sorts the list in place (does not return it). (The sorted() function shown below is preferred.)</li>

   <li> list.reverse() -- reverses the list in place (does not return it)</li>

   <li> list.pop(index) -- removes and returns the element at the given index. Returns the rightmost element if index is omitted (roughly the opposite of append()).</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that these are *methods* on a list object, while len() is a function that takes the list (or string or whatever) as an argument.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
  list = ['larry', 'curly', 'moe']
  list.append('shemp')         ## append elem at end
  list.insert(0, 'xxx')        ## insert elem at index 0
  list.extend(['yyy', 'zzz'])  ## add list of elems at end
  print list  ## ['xxx', 'larry', 'curly', 'moe', 'shemp', 'yyy', 'zzz']
  print list.index('curly')    ## 2

  list.remove('curly')         ## search and remove that element
  list.pop(1)                  ## removes and returns 'larry'
  print list  ## ['xxx', 'moe', 'shemp', 'yyy', 'zzz']
</pre>

<p>Common error: note that the above methods do not *return* the modified list, they just modify the original list.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
  list = [1, 2, 3]
  print list.append(4)   ## NO, does not work, append() returns None
  ## Correct pattern:
  list.append(4)
  print list  ## [1, 2, 3, 4]
</pre>

<h2>List Build Up</h2>

<p>One common pattern is to start a list a the empty list [], then use append() or extend() to add elements to it:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
  list = []          ## Start as the empty list
  list.append('a')   ## Use append() to add elements
  list.append('b')
</pre>

<h2>List Slices</h2>

<p>Slices work on lists just as with strings, and can also be used to change sub-parts of the list.</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
  list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
  print list[1:-1]   ## ['b', 'c']
  list[0:2] = 'z'    ## replace ['a', 'b'] with ['z']
  print list         ## ['z', 'c', 'd']
