      A Python and Django tutorial for beginners.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Welcome to <em>Django for Beginners</em>, a step-by-step approach to learning web development with <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a>. In this book you will learn how to create five progressively more complex web applications and employ Django best-practices around testing and deployment.</p>

<p>You don’t need to have previous Python programming experience. The book is intentionally written so that even a total beginner can follow along and feel the magic of writing their own web applications from scratch. However if you are serious about a career in web development, you will eventually need to invest the time to learn Python, HTML, and CSS properly. A list of recommended resources for further study is included in <a href="/conclusion/">the Conclusion</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote this book because while Django is <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/">extremely well documented</a> and has a very welcoming community, there is a distinct lack of beginner-friendly tutorials available. Most content is aimed at experienced developers already comfortable with web development rather than beginners trying to make sense of Django, Python, and web development–often all at the same time. When I learned Django years ago, I spent far too much time on things that felt hard, but in hindsight were simply poorly explained. My goal in this book is to save you the same headaches and demonstrate how powerful and approachable Django really is.</p>

<h2 id="book-structure">Book Structure</h2>
<p>In the <a href="chapter_01.html">first chapter</a> we review how to properly configure a computer for web development. We’re using bleeding edge tools in this book: the most recent version of Django (2.0), Python (3.6), and <a href="https://docs.pipenv.org/">Pipenv</a> to manage our virtual environments.</p>

<p>In <a href="chapter_03.html">Chapter 2</a> we build our first project, a minimal <em>hello world</em> application that demonstrates how to setup new Django projects. Because establishing good software practices is important, we’ll also save our work with <em>git</em> and upload a copy to a remote code repository on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product">Bitbucket</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="chapter_03.html">Chapter 3</a> we make and deploy a <em>simple</em> app that introduces templates, class-based views, tests, and deployment. Templates are how Django allows for DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) development with HTML and CSS. Class-based views require a minimal amount of code to use and extend core functionality in Django. They’re awesome as you’ll soon see. We also add our first tests and deploy to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> which has a free tier we’ll use throughout this book. Using platform-as-a-service providers like Heroku transforms development from a painful, time-consuming process into something that takes just a few mouse clicks.</p>

<p>By <a href="chapter_04.html">Chapter 4</a> we’re ready for our first database-backed application, a <em>message board</em> app. Django provides a powerful ORM that allows us to write concise Python for our database tables. We’ll explore the built-in admin app which is a truly killer feature that no other web framework has. It provides a graphical way to interact with our data and can be even used as a Content Management System (CMS) similar to Wordpress. Of course we also write tests for all our code, store a remote copy on Bitbucket, and deploy to Heroku.</p>

<p>Next up in <a href="chapter_05.html">Chapters 5-7</a> is a robust blog application that demonstrates how to perform basic CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) functionality in Django. We’ll find that Django’s generic class-based views mean we have to write only a small amount of actual code for this! Then we’ll add forms and user authentication (login logout, signup).</p>

<p>Finally we’re ready for our final project: a <em>social messaging</em> app similar to Twitter. In <a href="/custom-user-model/">Chapter 8</a> we start our new project the right way with a custom user model and implement signup, login, and logout functionality. Then in <a href="/pages-app/">Chapter 9</a> we create a <em>pages</em> with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for layout styling. We complete our user registration flow with password change and reset via email in <a href="/password-change-reset/">Chapter 10</a>. Our core social messaging app and layout is built in <a href="/social-messaging-app/">Chapter 11</a>. In <a href="/comments-app/">Chapter 12</a> we add a <em>comments</em> app that introduces foreign keys and in <a href="/authorization/">Chapter 13</a> we’ll explore authorization by restricting parts of the app only to logged-in users.</p>

<p><a href="/conclusion/">The conclusion</a> provides an overview of the major concepts introduced in the book and a list of recommended resources for further learning.</p>

<p>While you can pick and choose chapters to read, the book’s structure is quite deliberate. Each app/chapter introduces a new concept and reinforces past teachings. I <strong>highly recommend</strong> reading it in order, even if you’re eager to skip ahead. Later chapters won’t cover previous material in the same depth as earlier chapters.</p>

<p>By the end of this book you’ll have an understanding of how Django works in practice, the ability to build apps on your own, and the background needed to fully take advantage of additional resources for learning intermediate and advanced Django techniques.</p>

<p>There are several “bonus” chapters on advanced Django concepts that will covered in-depth in a follow-up book, <a href="http://intermediatedjango.com/" target="\_blank">Intermediate Django</a>. They are included here to showcase the rich Django ecosystem available. The topics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/django-allauth/">adding social authentication</a> via 3rd party services like Gmail and Github</li>
  <li>using <a href="/docker-postgresql/">Docker and PostgreSQL</a> to mimic a production environment locally</li>
  <li>an <a href="/django-rest-framework/">introduction to Django Rest Framework</a></li>
  <li>how to build a <a href="/todo-list-api/">Django Rest Framework todo list API</a> consumed by a <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> frontend</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="book-layout">Book layout</h3>

<p>There are many code examples in this book, which are denoted as follows:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># This is Python code</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Hello</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">World</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>For brevity we will use dots <code class="highlighter-rouge">...</code> to denote existing code that remains unchanged, for example in a function we are updating.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">make_my_website</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"All done!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We will also use the command line console frequently (starting in <a href="/initial-setup/">Chapter 1: Initial Setup</a>) to execute commands, which take the form of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code> prefix in traditional Unix style.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ echo "hello, world"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The result of this particular command is the next line will state:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>"hello, world"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We will typically combine a command and its output. The command will always be prefaced by a <code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code> and the output will not. For example, the command and result above will be represented as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ echo "hello, world"
hello, world
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Complete source code for all examples can be found on Github in the <a href="https://github.com/wsvincent/djangoforbeginners">Django for Beginners repository</a>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Django is an excellent choice for any developer who wants to build modern, robust web applications with a minimal amount of code. In the next chapter we’ll cover how to properly install Django, Python 3, and virtual environments.</p>
